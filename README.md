• Fine-tuned Llama-3 (8B) using QLoRA (0.52% params · 99% cheaper)
• +90% ROUGE-L · +133% BLEU · +43% BERTScore improvements
• Built scalable FastAPI backends (Linux · Nginx · CI/CD · SSL)

• Focus: scalable AI infra, retrieval optimization, agent orchestration

Building AI systems that actually work — in production.
